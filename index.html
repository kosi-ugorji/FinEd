        <p>“Working with FinEd was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I came to them unsure of where to start, but they guided me through every step with professionalism and care. When helping me search for schools in Canada, they considered so many important factors that I would have completely overlooked on my own — such as the city, school size, program structure, scholarship opportunities, and overall affordability.
They helped me find a school that was a perfect fit not just academically, but also personally and financially. They also prepared me thoroughly for my interview with the school, which gave me the confidence I needed — and I ended up receiving an entry scholarship!

Their support didn’t stop there. They walked me through the entire visa application process, and thanks to their expertise, my study permit was approved in just three months. I truly could not have done it without them.

I highly recommend FinEd to anyone planning to study in Canada — they genuinely care and go the extra mile to help you succeed.

        <p>“Working with FinEd on my essays was the single most impactful step in my Ivy League journey. 
          When I first approached them, my personal statement felt unfocused and flat. Through targeted one-on-one workshops, 
          they taught me how to uncover my authentic voice, weave my leadership and community experiences into a compelling 
          narrative, and tailor every essay to reflect what Ivy League admissions committees truly value. Their iterative 
          feedback process—line-by-line edits, brainstorming sessions, and mock prompt drills—turned my drafts from generic 
          to unforgettable.
            Thanks to FinEd’s expert essay coaching, I earned my acceptance to Columbia University with a 
          prestigious full-ride scholarship. Since arriving on campus, I’ve been honored with the 
          Leadership and Excellence Award, the SEAS student activity award, the multicultural affairs award, 
          and Senior Marshall's honor. FinEd didn’t just help me get in—they set me up to excel.”</p>

        <p> "Before I found FinEd, I was overwhelmed by U.S. applications—SAT/ACT, 
            TOEFL, financial aid, campus visits—it felt impossible. FinEd 
          created a personalized roadmap, helping me build a balanced college list
          and craft essays that showcased my unique story. They even ran mock admissions interviews 
          that boosted my confidence. I was accepted to Calvin University .
          When it was time for my visa, FinEd’s detailed checklist and interview coaching made all the difference.
          My F-1 visa was granted on the first try, just in time for move-in. Their end-to-end service—from 
          school selection to visa approval—was seamless. I highly recommend FinEd to any student aiming for the U.S.”</p>
